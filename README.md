# Cipher

## This cipher can be used to encrypt and/or decrypt any text you like!

This project, written in Python, allowed me to learn fundamental programming concepts such as: variables, functions, loops, conditional statements and string manipulation.

This project is based on part of the "Scientific Computing with Python (Beta)" course, provided by freeCodeCamp, which can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/
